Data Loading and Exploration:

Loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn

Creates a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation

Provides statistical summaries and visualizations

Data Preprocessing:

Splits data into training and test sets

Standardizes features using StandardScaler

Model Training:

Tests multiple classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Evaluates each model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix

Feature Importance:

Identifies which features are most important for classification

Visualizes feature importance

Saving Results:

Saves visualizations to image files

Saves the best performing model for future use


The script will:

Print statistical summaries of the dataset

Generate visualization plots (saved as PNG files)

Display evaluation metrics for each model

Identify the best performing model

Show feature importance (for models that support it)
